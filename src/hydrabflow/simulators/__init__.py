"""Simulators (forward models).

Importing this package imports the shipped simulators so they self-register in the registry.
Add your own by creating a module here with an ``@register_simulator("name")``-decorated subclass
of :class:`BaseSimulator`, then import it here (or rely on it being imported by your config).
